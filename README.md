# FP-Projects  
**Python Projects for Programming Fundamentals, 1st Year Class of Computer Science and Engineering at Instituto Superior Técnico**

This project consists of a Python program that simulates the **Go** board game, a strategy game for two players where the goal is to control the most territory by placing stones of the player's color on a grid. The project is divided into two parts, each building upon the previous one to create a complete game logic system.

### 📋 Features  
- **Part 1**:  
  - Implemented basic functions to manipulate a Go board.  
  - Defined abstract data types for game-related entities such as stones, the board, and territories.  
  - Focused on Python programming basics.

- **Part 2**:  
  - Developed and implemented game rules such as capturing stones and territory calculation.  
  - Enhanced board management with more efficient strategies for move validation and application of game rules.  
  - Integrated strategies for handling different game scenarios intelligently.
