# FP-Projects
Python projects for Programming Fundamentals, a 1º year class of Computer Science and Engineering Student @ Instituto Superior Técnico.

This project consisted of writing a program in Python that allows you to play Go1. For this purpose, we had to define a set of abstract data types that should be used to manipulate information necessary during the game. 
Go is an abstract strategy board game for two players. The players they alternately place stones of their color on the board, with the basic objective of forming territories around empty regions of the board. Whoever reaches the highest score, which basically corresponds to control of a larger territory. 

The 1º Project commit:
Was a base code so that we got used to Python programming and consisted of developing a couple of easy functions.

The 2º Project commit:
Involved strategy for applying the rules of the actual game in a smart and efficient way.
